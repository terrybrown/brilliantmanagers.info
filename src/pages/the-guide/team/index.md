  <summary>Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)</summary>

  #### Definition
  Creating an environment where people of all backgrounds feel valued, respected, and able to contribute their best work. This includes addressing bias, ensuring equitable opportunities, and leveraging diverse perspectives for better outcomes, including cross-cultural and global team considerations.

  #### Why It Matters
  Companies with diverse leadership teams are 70% more likely to capture new markets and 45% more likely to report growth in market share. Inclusive teams make better decisions and are more innovative, while team members perform better when they feel they belong.

  #### This Is Strong When:
  * Your team composition reflects diversity in multiple dimensions (background, experience, perspective)
  * All team members participate meaningfully in discussions and decisions
  * You actively address bias in hiring, promotion, and performance evaluation
  * Different cultural perspectives are valued and integrated into team approaches
  * Team members feel comfortable expressing their authentic selves
  * You can manage across time zones and cultural differences effectively
  * Underrepresented voices are amplified rather than overlooked

  #### Warning Signs:
  * Your team lacks diversity or certain groups are underrepresented in leadership
  * Some team members consistently dominate discussions while others remain quiet
  * Cultural differences create misunderstandings or tension
  * Hiring and promotion decisions consistently favor similar types of people
  * Team members code-switch or hide aspects of their identity at work
  * Global team members feel disconnected or undervalued
  * You don't notice or address microaggressions or exclusionary behavior

  #### Pathways to Improvement:
  * Learn about unconscious bias and implement bias interruption techniques
  * Read "The Culture Map" by Erin Meyer for managing across cultures
  * Actively seek diverse perspectives when making decisions
  * Create psychological safety for people to share different viewpoints
  * Examine your hiring and promotion processes for bias

  <summary>Coaching and Mentoring</summary>

  #### Definition
  Helping team members develop their skills, advance their careers, and solve problems through asking powerful questions, providing guidance, and sharing experience rather than just giving answers.

  #### Why It Matters
  Teams with managers who coach effectively are 21% more profitable and have 40% lower turnover. Coaching develops your team's capabilities, increases engagement, and creates succession planning for key roles.

  #### This Is Strong When:
  * You ask questions that help people discover solutions rather than telling them what to do
  * Team members come to you not just with problems but with proposed solutions
  * You can see potential in people and help them develop new capabilities
  * Your team members are getting promoted and advancing their careers
  * You share relevant experiences and lessons learned without making it about you
  * People seek you out for career advice and guidance
  * You tailor your coaching approach to each person's learning style and goals

  #### Warning Signs:
  * You immediately jump to solutions rather than helping people think through problems
  * Team members don't seem to be growing in their roles over time
  * You're the bottleneck for decisions because you haven't developed others' judgment
  * People don't come to you for career guidance or development conversations
  * Your team members struggle with the same issues repeatedly
  * You give advice based on what worked for you without considering individual differences
  * Team members feel like they're not learning or being challenged

  #### Pathways to Improvement:

  <summary>One-to-Ones</summary>

  #### Definition
  Regular, structured conversations between you and each team member focused on their growth, challenges, career development, and alignment with team goals. These are private spaces for building relationships and providing personalized support.

  #### Why It Matters
  Research shows that managers who conduct effective 1:1s have teams with 3x higher engagement and 5x lower turnover. These conversations are your primary tool for understanding each person as an individual, catching issues early, and building the trust necessary for high performance.

  #### This Is Strong When:
  * You consistently hold them (weekly or bi-weekly) and rarely cancel
  * You prepare with an agenda but let them drive the conversation

  * You ask open-ended questions like "What's energizing you?" or "What obstacles can I remove?"

  * Team members come prepared and seem engaged
  * Difficult topics get addressed before they become bigger problems

  #### Warning Signs:
  * Sessions frequently get cancelled or postponed
  * Conversations turn into status meetings about projects
  * You do most of the talking
  * Team members seem disengaged or give only surface-level responses
  * Issues that come up in 1:1s surprise you later in larger settings
  * People stop bringing up challenges or concerns
  * You feel like you don't really know your team members as individuals

  #### Pathways to Improvement:
  * Read "The Making of a Manager" by Julie Zhuo - excellent chapter on 1:1s
  * Try the "Start, Stop, Continue" framework for structured feedback
  * Use the "Manager Tools" podcast approach: 10 minutes their agenda, 10 minutes your agenda, 10 minutes career development
  * Ask better questions: "What would make your job more enjoyable?" "What's something I could do differently as your manager?"
  * Create a simple template to track themes and commitments across sessions
  * Shadow other managers' 1:1 approaches or get coaching from your own manager

  #### Definition

  #### Why It Matters
  Teams with high accountability are 2.5x more likely to be engaged and achieve better results. Accountability builds trust, ensures reliable execution, and creates an environment where people can depend on each other.

  * Team members consistently follow through on commitments without being reminded
  * You model accountability by keeping your own promises and admitting when you don't
  * There are clear consequences for both meeting and missing commitments
  * People take ownership of problems and work to solve them rather than making excuses
  * You have systems to track commitments and follow up appropriately

  #### Definition
  Identifying and removing obstacles that prevent your team from being productive, whether they're technical, procedural, political, or resource-related. This includes escalating issues appropriately and shielding your team from unnecessary friction.

  #### Why It Matters
  Removing blockers is one of the highest-leverage activities for managers. Teams that feel supported and unblocked are more productive, engaged, and able to focus on high-value work rather than fighting against organizational friction.
