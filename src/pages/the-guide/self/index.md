All change and growth starts with self, and there are a number of skills and traits of effective managers that would be considered personal or ‘self’.

  <summary>Time and Task Management</summary>

  #### Definition
  The ability to prioritize work effectively, manage your calendar strategically, and create systems that help you stay organized and focused on high-impact activities while maintaining work-life boundaries.

  #### Why It Matters
  Managers who excel at time management are 25% more productive and create 40% less stress for their teams. Your time management directly models behavior for your team and affects your ability to be present for important conversations and decisions.

  #### This Is Strong When:
  * You consistently arrive prepared for meetings and rarely run late
  * You block calendar time for important but non-urgent work like strategic thinking
  * You delegate effectively rather than trying to do everything yourself
  * You can quickly assess and communicate priorities when new requests come in
  * Your team knows when you're available and respects your focused work time
  * You regularly review and adjust your systems based on what's working
  * You maintain boundaries that allow for rest and personal time

  #### Warning Signs:
  * You're constantly in reactive mode, jumping from crisis to crisis
  * Meetings run over and you're always rushing to the next commitment
  * Important work gets pushed aside by urgent but less critical tasks
  * You work excessive hours but don't feel like you're making progress on key goals
  * Your team interrupts you frequently because they can't predict your availability
  * You forget commitments or miss deadlines regularly
  * You feel overwhelmed and struggle to see the bigger picture

  #### Pathways to Improvement:
  * Try time-blocking: schedule specific time for different types of work
  * Read "Getting Things Done" by David Allen for comprehensive organization systems
  * Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks by urgency and importance
  * Implement "office hours" so your team knows when you're available for questions
  * Track your time for a week to understand where it actually goes

  <summary>Empathy and Compassion</summary>

  #### Definition
  The ability to understand and share the feelings of your team members, showing genuine care for their wellbeing and experiences while maintaining professional boundaries and making fair decisions.

  #### Why It Matters
  Teams with empathetic managers show 50% lower turnover and higher engagement. Empathy builds psychological safety, enables better problem-solving, and helps you make decisions that consider the human impact, not just business metrics.
  
  #### This Is Strong When:
  * You notice when team members are struggling before they have to tell you
  * People feel comfortable sharing personal challenges that might affect their work
  * You can put yourself in others' shoes when making decisions that affect them
  * Your responses to team concerns feel genuine and thoughtful rather than scripted
  * You balance compassion with accountability - caring doesn't mean lowering standards
  * You remember important personal details and follow up appropriately
  * Difficult conversations happen with kindness even when delivering hard messages

  #### Warning Signs:
  * Team members seem surprised when you show interest in their wellbeing
  * You focus solely on work outcomes without considering personal circumstances
  * People don't come to you when they're facing challenges
  * Your attempts at empathy feel forced or performative
  * You either become too involved in personal issues or remain completely detached
  * You make decisions based purely on logic without considering emotional impact
  * Team members describe you as "cold" or "all business"

  #### Pathways to Improvement:
  * Practice active listening - focus entirely on understanding before responding
  * Read "Nonviolent Communication" by Marshall Rosenberg for empathetic communication
  * Ask open-ended questions about how people are feeling, not just what they're doing
  * Share appropriate personal stories to model vulnerability
  * Pay attention to body language and energy levels in your team

  <summary>Growth Mindset</summary>

  #### Definition
  The belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence. This includes embracing challenges, learning from failure, and continuously seeking to improve yourself and help others grow.
  
  #### Why It Matters
  Research by Carol Dweck shows that teams with growth-mindset leaders are 34% more likely to feel committed to their company and 65% more likely to say their company supports risk-taking. Your mindset directly influences your team's willingness to innovate and develop.
  
  #### This Is Strong When:
  * You openly discuss your own learning goals and areas for improvement
  * You treat failures as learning opportunities rather than reasons for punishment

  * You regularly seek feedback and act on it visibly
  * You celebrate effort and progress, not just final outcomes
  * You invest time in your own professional development consistently
  * Your language focuses on "how can we learn from this?" rather than "who's to blame?"

  #### Warning Signs:
  * You avoid challenges or new responsibilities that might expose weaknesses
  * Team members seem afraid to admit mistakes or ask for help
  * You focus primarily on hiring people who already have all necessary skills
  * Failure leads to blame rather than analysis and improvement
  * You haven't changed your approach or learned new skills in the past year
  * Your team doesn't take risks or suggest innovative solutions
  * You defend your current methods rather than exploring alternatives

  #### Pathways to Improvement:
  * Read "Mindset" by Carol Dweck to understand fixed vs. growth mindset patterns
  * Start each team meeting by sharing something you're learning or want to improve
  * When things go wrong, ask "What can we learn?" before "What went wrong?"
  * Set learning goals for yourself alongside performance goals
  * Celebrate team members who take thoughtful risks, even when they don't succeed
  * Find a mentor or coach who can challenge your thinking
  * Practice saying "I don't know, but I'll figure it out" instead of pretending to know everything

  #### Why It Matters
  Research shows that leaders who adapt their style to different situations achieve 30% better results than those who use only one approach. Different people and circumstances require different leadership approaches for optimal outcomes.

  <summary>Cross-functional Skillset</summary>

  #### Definition
  Understanding and developing capabilities beyond your core domain expertise, including knowledge of other business functions, technical skills, and the ability to work effectively across different disciplines.

  #### Why It Matters

  #### Why It Matters
  Brené Brown's research shows that vulnerable leaders create more innovative, engaged teams. Courage and vulnerability model the behavior you want to see and create psychological safety for others to take risks and be honest.

## OR

* **Time and Task Management** - the difference between chaotically shuffling your diary and always having perpetual todos and having a clean inbox, protected time, and space to reflect and think.  Effective skills in this area make the difference between a manager that juggles priorities, and one who solves for the biggest issues with a laser focus.
* **Empathy and Compassion** - perhaps two of the most important skills in any managers toolbox.  You cannot effectively manage people or engage in conversations with stakeholders if you are not strong in these areas.  Those strongest in these skills will always consider situations from others’ perspectives, and will be masters of stepping into the shoes of those they talk to.
* **Growth Mindset** - you didn’t start as a manager, and you clearly did well in the roles you have had up until the point of management.  Being a manager is a lifelong learning pathway, and a growth mindset is crucial.  You have moved from being an expert in your domain as an individual contributor to a role that has its basis in human psychology, culture, learning, leadership, strategy - and these all require study and understanding.  The best managers will have demonstrable and objective measure of improvement in their skills.
* **Emotional Intelligence** - humans are emotionally led creatures, and our amygdala (that controls that ‘fight or flight’ reaction) can come into play just as easily in our business lives - we have all of us done or said things that we regret in a work setting.  An effective grounding in emotional intelligence lets us know ourself and choose ourself with regards to emotions, and is imperative when we move to humans being our primary interaction point in our business lives.  Effective managers will be in control of themselves, and will not demonstrate uncontrolled emotion.
* **Leadership Styles** - a lot of managers will favour or default to particular styles, but awareness that leadership isn’t a one-size-fits-all and knowing when to switch and mix styles of leadership will maximise outcomes.  The best managers here will switch between styles dependent upon situation, context, and needs of the environment, and will be fully versed in multiple styles.
* **Self Awareness** - as humans, we are flawed in many and unique ways.  Understanding your own position - your strengths and opportunities - is a great step towards better.  Do you always react badly to bad news delivered late? Do you struggle with courtesy when faced with aggression?  These are stimulus and data that you can learn and grow from.  Managers who struggle here will not be able to talk easily about their weak spots or growth areas, and those who are self aware will have an effective narrative to talk to you about them.
* **Cross-functional Skillset** - the best managers will have some understanding of others’ areas.  Be you an engineering manager that works with product management, or a legal manager that interacts with compliance.  [T-shaped people](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437) will often excel when faced with areas of cross-collaboration or stakeholder management.
* **Resilience** - our capacity to face challenges time and again, to face defeat and not give up, is a hallmark of effective management. Our ability to bounce back after challenge, especially those that go badly, and learn from it is fundamental in a role that will see us take risk and lead in uncertainty.  Great managers in this space are inspirational for their ability to rise from defeat time and again.
* **Vulnerability and Courage** - as [Brené Brown teaches us](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2019/01/10/four-skills-you-need-for-courageous-leadership/), these are keys to creativity and innovation, they allow us connection, and being an effective manager is about leaning into our vulnerability as a true path to courage.  Strong managers will be comfortable leaning on their teams and admitting they screwed up, or they don’t have the answers.
